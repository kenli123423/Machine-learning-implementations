Feature : **Features are some characteristics in training data which they help doing the task** .We believe machine learns features from training data to finish the task very accurately, such as textures, colours, edges from images. Extracting features is an important goal of machine learning, by extracting feataures machine can do the assigned task very accurately. In CNN, feature maps usually mean the matrix after convolution and max-pooling. Which they contains features, some we may understand how they help doing the task, but mostly, we dont.\n\n2. Learning Rate(Or step size) : When we are doing gradient descent optimization, we will calculate the gradient of loss against weight, then update the weight, step size measures **how big the step will be**, which is how the name \"step size\" come.\n\n3. Bias : In machine learning, bias means the model has **bias or prejudice** to the input data, which might leads to inaccuarate prediction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inspiration of CNN\n- We can dive deeper into how human eyes work before we introduce CNN. In accordance to Hubel and Wiesel's (1959) research, they found that the visual cortex has small regions of cells that are sensitive to specific regions in the visual field. Which suggested that our eye might **not** be attentive to everywhere in our visual field.\n\n- Hence, this inspires how can we make a model to process images, we first make a **kernel**, which its dimension is small compared to the whole image, then we slides the kernel in the image to get some features in the image to simulate how our eyes catch the light details of an object. Then we can send these \"signals\"(feature maps in machine learning) to our brain for further processings, such as identification and classification.\n  ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1. Convolution**\n- Convolution serves a major part in convolutional neural network, it is the \"soul\" of CNN, lets start from its mathematical definition, the conovlution of 2 functions f(t) and g(t) is defined as :\n\n  $$f(t) \\ast g(t) = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty} f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau) d\\tau$$\n\nThe above definition can be generalized to grid-structured data such as matrix, in fact, in CNN, we use matrix to represent data more frequently, hence, we are able to define convolution for matrix, which is **dot product** of 2 matrices, because the convolution formula becomes :\n\n$$Y(i,j) = \\sum^{h-1}_{m=0} \\sum^{w-1}_{n=1} X(i+m, j+n)\\cdot W(m,n)$$\n\nWhich is a element-wise dot product.\n\n\n**2. Image representation**\n- How do we represent images in computer? There are 3 major components in image representation, which are **channels, height, width**. Height and Width are very easy to understand, what about channels?\n\n- Well, we know that the most basic part in an image is **pixel**, **channel can be imagined as how many layers of rectangles you stacked where all these layers of rectangles have the same height and width**.\n\n- For example, if channel = 1, it is simply grayscale image. If channel=3, it is RGB images, where you have 3 layers of rectangles here, Red, Green and Blue one. Each layer has same dimension. More channels allow the feature map to store more features but also lead to tremendous increment on memory usage and computational requirement, hence increasing channel is a trade-off between computational efficiency and model representation power.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# > **CNN architecture**\n\n# 1. **Convolution**\n\nWhen we have received an input image, we will immediately do convolution on the images, so what is the details?\n\n  (The following shapes representations followed by Numpy traditions on representing matrix shapes)\n\n  Suppose the input image has a shape of **(channels, height, width)**, at first, we have to initialize our filters into shape of **(output_channels, input_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)**, for those who love math, here's for you :\n\n$$X \\in \\mathcal{R}^{H \\times W\\times C}$$\n$$W \\in \\mathcal{R}^{W_h \\times W_w \\times C_{in} \\times C_{out} \\times N}$$\n\n$C_{in}$ and $C_{out}$ means the **output and input channels of the feature map**\n\nHow about the values inside these matrices? We mostly use some popular initialization techniques, for CNN, obviously He Intialization is the best, it is proposed by He. K. Zhang et.al(2015), where the values are given by :\n\n  $$w \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_l}})$$\n\nThe shape of the feature map after convolution is :\n\n$$F_{q+1} = \\frac{F_q-B_q+2P}{S} + 1$$\n\nNote that it can only be applied to calculate width and height of feature map, we will explain how this formula is derived in later section.\n\nAnd the mathematical formula for convolution is :\n\n$$h^{q+1}_{rsp} = \\sum^{B_q}_{i=1} \\sum^{B_q}_{j=1} \\sum^{d_{q+1}}_{k=1} w^{(p,q)}_{rsk}\\cdot h^{q}_{rS+i-P, sS+j-P,k} = \\sum_{(i,j,k) \\in \\mathcal{K}} w^{(p,q)}_{rsk}\\cdot h^{q}_{rS+i-P, sS+j-P,k}$$\n\nFor most general case, batch is included :\n$$ = \\sum_{(i,j,k,n) \\in \\mathcal{K}} w^{(p,q)}_{rsk}\\cdot h^{q}_{rS+i-P, sS+j-P,k,n}$$\n\nIt looks very complex, but let me explain them by part ! GIF 1 gives you a more simpler explanation by demonstrating it visually !\n\n$F_q$ is the shape of feature map in qth layer, $B_q$ is the shape of kernel connecting between q and (q+1)th layer, just think of it as weights connecting 2 layers, as you use this kernel to convolve with feature map(simply doing dot product) in qth layer to get the feature map in (q+1)th layer. Here we got 2 more new variables, S and P, who are they? They are **strides and padding** !\n\n* Strides : Stride means when we are sliding filter in the feature map, **how many grids do we slide when in 1 move**, usually if stride is larger, we use less memory and computational power as we perform less dot product between kernel and selected region.\n  \nThe convolution is performed at position of :\n\n  $$1, S+1, 2S+1, .....$$ for S>1 \n  \n* In the demonstration below, it used stride=2, which means the kernel will move 2 grid in each move.\n\n\n* Padding : In the above examples of demonstration of Convolution, you may have discovered that, after the convolution, the feature map dimension will be smaller, that is the nature of convolution, but unfortunately, it is **undesirable**, because the reduce of size leads to **some loss of information**, so the goal of padding is to solve this issue, how do we make the shape between and before convolution the same? That's right, that's the add some numbers around the feature map border, usually the number is 0, by adding padding into feature map, we can retain the shape of feature map !\n\n\nNow look back at the shape formula we wrote in the beginning :\n\n$$F_{q+1} = \\frac{F_q-B_q+2P}{S} + 1$$\n\n$F_q - B_q$ is caused by dot product, **only one scalar value will be returned after the dot product**, we simply stack these values together to create a feature map !\n\nSuppose we add padding with thickness $P$ in the border, then our height/width dimension is increased by $2P$(dimension increased P in each side), hence we have $+2P$.\n\n$/S$ and the $+1$ due to stride, because convolution start in the first position of the feature map, as we move $S$ grids at each move, the required times of convolution is divided by $S$.\n\n* **Little Conclusion of this part**:\n  - Stride : How many grids your kernel moves in 1 convolution.\n  - Padding : Thickness of zeros you add in the border of your feature map, pad=0 means no padding, in most libraries, \"same\" padding meaning that the spatial dimensions of feature map before and after convolution is the same, which suggested that it uses zero-padding to retain the shape, for \"valid\" padding, it simply equals to no use of padding.

(2006)*, the basic idea is to turn the kernel and feature maps into **column matrix**, hence we can change the series of dot product into matrix multiplication, then we can use the optimized BLAS library to boost the convolution. \n\n1. Flatten the kernel\n   \nBy the following command, we can flatten our kernel :\n\n**np.reshape(kernel, (out_channel ,-1))**\n\n2. Slides over the feature map\n\nNext we have to let our original kernel to slides over the feature map like normal convolution, but instead of performing **dot product**, we are going to reshape the **selected region** into column matrix.\n\nDefine a region proposal as $R$, where it is matrix with shape :\n\n\nAfter we finished this process, we can stack all the column matrix together, the number of rows indicate **how many times our kernel has slides over the feature map**.\n\n3. Matrix Multiplication\n\nIn real situation, with consideration to the channels, our column matrix should be a 2D array, as well as kernel.
